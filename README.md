# demon-slayer-game
This is a memory game to match Demon Slayer characters.

Prep time => 90 min
Development time => 4hrs 30min

Wanted to use Demon Slayer API, but it's missing a CORS header to allow cross-origin. I didn't know how to setup a local proxy to by-pass it.

Reflection:
Spent way too much time thiking about features
Should have focused on the 3 must-have functionalities
Improved understanding of CSS grid
Understood Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm, but wasn't successful in implementation
Better understanding of axios and API requests
Reinforced learning about useEffect and HOF
Learned how to access the value of a div with data-value attribute
